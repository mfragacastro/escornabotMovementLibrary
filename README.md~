# escornabotMovementLibrary
Attempt to create a library for controlling escornabot with simple commands.
## List of commands:
### anda(steps)
Makes escornabot move that amount of steps.Negative steps give backward movements
###  xira(steps)
Makes escornabot turn that amount of steps. Well, kind of, both motors move that amount of steps in different directions. Negative steps give counter-clockwise turns.
###  pause(time)
Stops moving for given time.
## List of possible features
### Start movement on button press
Use a button on the keypad to start the program that is loaded, instead of doing it right after upload.
### Move in different units
Make functions to move distance units or turn degrees instead of steps.
### Do not use loops
For the very beginner, maybe it's better to have a lineal program that doesn't execute infinitely. Look for the best way to implement this, though I know it may be working against Arduino nature.
